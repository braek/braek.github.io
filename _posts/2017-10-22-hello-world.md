This is the first post of my newly created **blog.**

## Lazy Sunday, Lego Sunday

Today we created a **yellow version** of the [Lego 10220 Volkswagen T1 Camper Van](https://shop.lego.com/en-BE/Volkswagen-T1-Camper-Van-10220).

I spent about **25 euro** on getting the necessary yellow parts through [BrickLink](http://www.bricklink.com/).

Check this **cool eye-catcher** for yourself in the picture below! :-)
